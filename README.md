# ClipboardPlaceholder
Simple pulgin to add {clipboard} as a Placeholder for KeePass AutoType feature.

It only works for auto-type, it does not add a new placeholder to the general placeholder feature of KeePass (Yet?).
Special Keys in https://keepass.info/help/base/autotype.html#autoseq are supported.
